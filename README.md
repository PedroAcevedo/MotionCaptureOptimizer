<b>Step 2) </b> 

Download the Unity 2020.3.18f1 version from the "Installs" tab.

<b>Step 3) </b> 

Clone the project from GitHub as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/PedroAcevedo/MotionCaptureOptimizer
```
<b>Step 4) </b> 

Open the project with Unity Hub.

<b>Step 5) </b> 

Go to Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity and select the scene on Unity.

<b>Step 6) </b> 

Press the play button on the top menu. And the algorithm will execute like this:

### Reproduce Figure 5

To reproduce one of the outputs from Figure 5, we can follow the next steps:

1. Select the Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity scene.
2. Press the play button in the top menu.
3. Wait until the algorithm finishes, and you can see the optimized marker set layout on the prop (Umbrella) on a white background.
4. You can take a screenshot by pressing the left mouse button, which will be saved in the "Assets/Screenshot." folder.
5. Press the "X" button to display different prop designs and markers.
